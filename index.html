            <p>Our story starts with our founder George and a greasy burger van parked outside of a gym in Koh Samui, Thailand. After long days at work, followed by grueling training sessions, Georgeâ€™s biggest challenge was finding the time to eat well. Ordering food was generally an unhealthy option, with little nutritionally valuable food available in the takeaway market. This greasy burger van, in the right place at the right time with the wrong product, gave George his Eureka moment! There was a massive gap in the market for a fitness-focused takeaway food brand and with that, Gym Food was born.</p>
